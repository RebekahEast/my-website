            <h2>Hello! So you've come to this page to learn about me? Well you are in luck!</h2>

    <p>Where do I start? I was born in the home of the concrete cows - Milton Keynes (see the pic above of the concrete cows in all their glory!). I went to school and followed a passion in STEM through two degrees at Uni. I ended up finding a passion for Events and left the world of Science behind to practice Event Management for a little while.</p>
    <p>I've always been drawn to software, tech, and coding! But never know how to take the jump and get into it. Well! I took the plunge and started to teach myself through online resources. I've met friends, old and new, along the way also practicing coding on the side of their fulltime job. We just cannot get enough!</p>

    <p><em>What more can I tell you? </em>Well I'm thinking the same thing as I type. I live in London, I have a pet cat called Juniper, and two dogs with my family in Milton Keynes called Phoebe and Leo. More info on them on the pets tab! Check them out, I'm sure they'll love it.</p>
    <p>Again, more about this in the hobbies section, but I'm a plant lover, crafter, tattoo enthusiast, and hot sauce eater. </p>
