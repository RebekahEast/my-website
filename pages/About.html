        <p>Hello! So you've come to this page to learn about me? Well you are in luck! This page is dedicated to all things Rebekah.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Where do I start? I was born in the home of the concrete cows - Milton Keynes. I went to school and followed a career in STEM through two degrees at Uni. I ended up finding a passion for Events and left the world of Science behind to practice Event Management</p>
    <p>I've always been drawn to software, tech, and coding! But never know how to take the jump and get into it. Well! I took the plunge and started to teach myself through online resources. </p>
