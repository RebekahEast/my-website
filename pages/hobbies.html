            <h3>Crafting</h3>
            <p>Crafting is a verrryy big hobby of mine. You'd usually find me in the evenings chilling on a sofa with a mug of peppermint tea and getting into my current crafting project. I can crochet, knit, sew, and I can make macrame. At the moment, I'm learning how to make more wearable items <em>(including a jumper!)</em></p>

            <p>I'm a hot sauce fiend. Put it on just about everything. I grow my own chillies every year and make a small hot sauce.</p>
