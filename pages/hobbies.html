        <p>Crafting is a very big hobby of mine. You'd usually find me in the evenings chilling on a sofa with a mug of peppermint tea and getting into my current crafting project. I can crochet, knit, sew, and I can make macrame. At the moment, I'm learning how to make more wearable items <em>(including a jumper!)</em>. </p>
        <p>I've always enjoyed crafting, and from a young age I learnt how to knit from my grandmother. It's something I'm proud to be able to do, as a skill!</p>
        <p>Take a look at a recently completed project here!</p>

        <p>I'm a hot sauce fiend. Put it on just about everything. I grow my own chillies every year and make a small hot sauce with chillies, carrots, garlic and other ingredients on the hob. I love to grow items, and then if I can cook with them - even better!</p>
        <p>In the past I have grown cucumbers, chillies, tomatoes, and avocados! Well not actually avocados, just the plant for now. It can take up to 10 years to get avocados from their plants.. So I have some waiting to do. Same thing with my lemon plant, I'm in it for the long game!</p>
        <p>I also spend a large amount of time cooking, every type of cuisine too! My favourite meal to cook is a probably a vegetarian lasagna or a mushroom ramen with tenderstem broccoli. We love to follow Ottolenghi's recipes - our fave is actually his mushroom lasanga. It genuinely takes 3+ hours, but sooo worth it! I also recently got into making my own pasta, which just tops everything off as a fab meal!</p>
